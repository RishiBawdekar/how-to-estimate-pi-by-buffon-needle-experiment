    <section class="main-content">
      <p>In 1777, French mathematician Georges-Louis Leclerc, later Comte de Buffon (born on 7th September 1707) asked the following question:</p>

<p>Suppose you drop a short needle on a ruled paper – what is the probability that the needle comes to lie in a position where it crosses one of the lines?</p>

<p>Probability (p) : (2 / π) * (l / d)</p>

<p>A short needle is a needle whose length (l) is smaller than the distance between two parallel lines on the ruler (d). The probability depends on the ratio – l / d. Since the length is smaller than the distance, the needle will cross only one line on the ruler.</p>

<p>So, if I drop N needles and C out of them cross a line, my probability is C / N. Replacing and re-structuring the above equation we get:</p>

<p>π = 2 * (l / d) * (N / C)</p>

<p>This method is a type of Monte Carlo methods. The value of π is an approximation and the success of this method depends on two factors:</p>

<p>The ratio (l / d): In 1901, Italian mathematician Mario Lazzarini dropped a needle 3408 times and got success 1808 times. He chose (l / d) ratio as (5 / 6). The experiment yielded an approximation of π correct to six digits – 3.1415929.</p>

<p>Number of runs: More trials will yield better approximations.</p>
